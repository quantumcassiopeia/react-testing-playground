# 🛠️ **React Playground**  
Welcome to my testing and experimentation repository with React! 🚀  

## 📖 **Description**  
This repository is my sandbox for exploring and testing React features ⚛️. Here, I experiment with new concepts, libraries, and implement small ideas to learn and improve my skills. 💡  

## ✨ **What will you find here?**  
- Tests with **hooks** (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) 🎣  
- Implementations of **functional components** 🧩  
- Experiments with **React Router** 🚦  
- Tests of **state management** with Context API or Redux 🗂️  
- Integration with **external APIs** 🌐  
- And much more! 🎉  

## 🛡️ **Disclaimer**  
This repository is purely educational and experimental. Some implementations may not be optimized or fully functional. 😅
